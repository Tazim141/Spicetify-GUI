Installing Spicetify for Spotify on Windows using GUI

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and using Spicetify, a customization tool for Spotify on Windows. Please follow the steps below to get started:

#Step 1: Download and Install Spotify

To begin, you need to have Spotify installed on your Windows computer. If you haven't done so already, please follow these instructions:

Visit the official Spotify website at https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/.
Click on the download link to download the Spotify installer.
Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and double-click on it to start the installation process.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of Spotify on your computer.

#Step 2: Check for Updates (If Spotify is already installed)
If you already have Spotify installed on your computer, it's a good idea to check for updates before proceeding with the installation of Spicetify. Here's how you can do it:

Open the Spotify application on your Windows computer.
Click on the "Help" option in the top menu bar.
From the drop-down menu, select "Check for Updates."
If an update is available, follow the prompts to update your Spotify application. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

#Step 3: Run gui.exe

Now that you have Spotify installed (or updated), it's time to install and run Spicetify. Follow these steps:

Download the "Spicetify.zip" file from the official GitHub repository at https://github.com/Tazim141/Spicetify-GUI/releases/download/v1.0/Spicetify.zip .
Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the archive to a folder of your choice.
Locate the "gui.exe" file within the extracted Spicetify folder and left-click on "Install Spicetify" to run the program.

Note: Running "gui.exe" as an administrator is not necessary for its normal operation.

#Step 4: Keep Spotify Running in the Background

While using Spicetify, it's important to keep Spotify running in the background. This allows Spicetify to apply changes to your Spotify interface seamlessly. Spotify will automatically restart itself when installing Spicetify. Please be patient, as the process usually takes 2-3 minutes depending on your internet connection and computer speed.

#Step 5: Uninstalling Spicetify

If you wish to uninstall Spotify from your Windows computer, you can do so by following these steps:

Open "gui.exe"
Left-click on "Uninstall Spicetify" and wait, just like the installation process.

#Important Note: Reinstall Spicetify After Spotify Updates#
Spicetify requires reinstallation every time Spotify updates its application. Alternatively, you can disable automatic updates for Spotify to prevent conflicts with Spicetify. Please keep this in mind to ensure that Spicetify continues to function correctly.

We hope this guide has been helpful in installing and using Spicetify with Spotify on your Windows computer. If you have any further questions or encounter any issues, please refer to the official Spicetify documentation or community forums for assistance.
