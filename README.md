Open the Spotify application on your Windows computer.
Click on the "Help" option in the top menu bar.
From the drop-down menu, select "Check for Updates."
If an update is available, follow the prompts to update your Spotify application. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

#Step 3: Run gui.exe

Now that you have Spotify installed (or updated), it's time to install and run Spicetify. Follow these steps:

Download the "Spicetify.zip" file from the official GitHub repository at https://github.com/Tazim141/Spicetify-GUI/releases/download/v1.1/Spicetify.zip.
Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the archive to a folder of your choice.
Locate the "gui.exe" file within the extracted Spicetify folder and run the program as admin.


#Step 4: Installing Spicetify

Left click on "Install" and please be patient, as the process usually takes 2-3 minutes depending on your internet connection and computer speed. You can check the progress in the console prompt.

#Step 5: Uninstalling Spicetify

If you wish to uninstall Spotify from your Windows computer, you can do so by following these steps:

Open "gui.exe"
Left-click on "Uninstall" and wait, just like the installation process.

#Important Note: Reinstall Spicetify After Spotify Updates

Spicetify requires reinstallation every time Spotify updates its application. Alternatively, you can disable automatic updates for Spotify to prevent conflicts with Spicetify. Please keep this in mind to ensure that Spicetify continues to function correctly. This GUI uses official Spicetify client, it automatically installs the lastest version of Spicetify.
